h2 What is {{name}}?
p.pure-block {{name}} is a library makes it easy to interact with webpages by attaching components to elements. When elements get created, deleted, modified or get interacted with, {{name}} will know and alert your components.

h2 How is {{name}} powered?
div.pure-block
  p {{name}} is powered by messages which are sent from the library to your components. For example, when you watch an element and it gets added to the DOM, a message will be sent to your created event. From there you can do what ever you wish.
  p So, for example on horsepowerjs.com we use this to format and highlight all javascript whenever it gets added to the page on load or at some point thereafter.
  pre: code.language-javascript.
    class beautify extends hp.element {
      public created() {
        this.text = js_beautify(this.text, { indent_size: 2 })
        Prism.highlightElement(this.element)
      }
    }

    hp.observe('code.language-javascript', beautify)
